  Electronic shifters have become increasingly accessible for professional and casual riders, but they bring new security threats and technical challenges. Riders own safety depend on their bikes and they need to perform at their best. Because of their importance, we decided to take 3 shifters, each with a different wireless configuration, and test them against a variety of wireless attacks attempting to manipulate the bikes behavior without the riders consent, either to hurt their performance in a race, strand the user, or force them to crash.

  We limited ourselves to wireless attacks and studied the components design to try and find attacks that would work best. We found the SRAM groupset was vulnerable to replay attacks, and the Archer Components allowed unverified users to connect to the device. The Shimano Di2 system which relies on wired shifting appeared to be the most secure, as it's the only system with a password which requires you to restart the device if you enter the password incorrectly. This would require brute force attacks to have access to the physical device and take a long time, even for technically advanced users.

\section{Introduction}

% A paragraph of text goes here.  Lots of text.  Plenty of interesting text. \\

% More fascinating text. Features\endnote{Remember to use endnotes, not footnotes!} galore, plethora of promises.\\

Cycling has seen the emergence of electronic shifting technologies over the past few years. While the technology existed as far back as the 1990s, adoption has accelerated, especially for high-end bikes. As we see the technology improve, these shifters have become faster and more precise than mechanical shifting, allowing users to shift more quickly, shift standing, and prevent chain rub. Every major brand has introduced their own line of electronic shifters including Shimano, SRAM, Campagnolo, as well as smaller brands such as Archer.

The wireless shifters use an assortment of communication technologies known as Personal Area Networks (PAN’s) such as Bluetooth. The use of these technologies opens the once closed off bicycle to security vulnerabilities. If an attacker can trigger extraneous shifts the cyclist can be thrown off their bike causing personal injury and the potential for even larger accidents (cyclists in pro races are tightly packed causing crashes to spread quickly). While security research focused on these electronic shifters is sparse there exists a plethora of work exploring security for various Personal Area Network enabled devices. A subset of wireless shifters utilizes Bluetooth as a communication protocol which has been shown to have security flaws in several implementations~ \cite{JiWu}. One of the wireless shifting devices that we would like to examine is the SRAM eTAP system which utilizes their own novel Airea Personal Area Network protocol which allows their components to communicate from up to a hundred meters away. This large distance could allow an attacker to communicate with their components from an unobservable location.

\section{Related Work}

There has been a lot of work into researching how to break wireless networks on embedded electronic devices, especially those where security was not an upfront concern. Many simply use replay attacks and exploit design flaws with device authentication~ \cite{Halperin}. Other papers look broadly on the state of wireless security, and analyse methods surrounding IoT devices and wireless communication methods~\cite{Choi}~\cite{Radek}.

We attempted to take many of these findings and bring them to the electronic shifting space to see what sorts of vulnerabilities we could find. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive research on the security of wireless bike shifters. We studied the Archer Components D1X, SRAM eTap, and Shimano Di2 for vulnerabilities.

\section{Potential Impact}

Electronic shifters in bikes have become extremely popular among high-end bikes. Tadej Pogačar, the overall winner of the 2020 and 2021 tour won using a Campagnolo EPS shifter. Egan Bernal, the 2019 winner, won riding a Pinarello that used Shimano Dura Ace Di2 shifters~ \cite{GCNTech}. Furthermore, high-end bikes such as the Trek Madone 9 recommend electronic shifters.

Competitions also raise the stakes for the potential impact exploits may have. The Tour de France prize pool is 3.6 million AU, and many millions stand to be gained from partnerships and sponsors. Anyone who's able to impact a race in their favor may realize substantial financial gain, and we only expect the potential professional impacts to increase with time.

Casual cyclists are also impacted. Cycling is a sport where casual riders can go out for multi hour rides, and if their bike is disabled or their gears are changed unexpectedly a serious threat may be posed to their wellbeing, stranding them or causing them to crash. Because of these reasons we think the security of electronic shifters is an important topic that deserves research.

\subsection{Contributions}

In summary, our contributions to the field include analyzing the security landscape of wireless bike shifters according to our threat models, and providing recommendations to manufacturers moving forward. We found the SRAM shifter was susceptible to simple replay attacks, while the Archer Bluetooth authentication protocol was left completely open. Lastly we found Shimano was the most secure, rebuffing our attempts to break into it.

\subsection{Common Attacks Against IoT Devices}

Due to the nature of wireless IoT devices and their power limitations potential security flaws have been a concern for years~ \cite{HeXu}. Because the research body is so vast we will derive a few common attack vectors that we believe are most applicable to our study. The attack vectors that we will outline are Replay, Denial of Service, and Man in the Middle Attacks.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Replay Attacks} are conducted by recording communication signals between IoT Devices and replaying them. Usually defended against using some session key implementation, these false signals will be non-discernible from the legitimate commands.
  \item \textbf{Denial of Service (DoS)} attacks are effective against most wireless IoT devices. A lack of processing power and battery life often compounds these problems and may allow for a variety of new attacks, even including draining battery life of critical bike components~\cite{Moyers}.
  \item \textbf{Packet Spoofing} are similar to replay attacks however instead of sending the packet out as is the attacker retains the packet and modifies it. This can be used to increment counters, make commands the victim hasn't made yet, or attempt to force the device to perform undefined behavior. A high quality ecryption algorithm can make it hard to spoof packets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research in wireless attacks against other vehicles}

The ushering in of new technology to bicycles is reminiscent of the automotive industries push towards intelligent systems. These changes, however, come with security issues which were highlighted when Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles due to a remote hacking vulnerability that let adversaries control the vehicle and even cut the brakes~\cite{ChryslerRecall}. Remote vehicle hacking has been demonstrated across multiple manufacturers (Tesla, BMW, Chrysler) ~\cite{Tesla}~\cite{BMW}~\cite{Chrysler} and research into the security of such systems is now commonplace~\cite{dibaei2019overview}. Systems utilized by intelligent vehicles such as vehicular ad hoc networks~\cite{SAKIZ201733} (VAHN)enabling vehicle to vehicle communication have been studied and found to pose security risks~\cite{ SAKIZ201733}. With the rise of intelligent/wireless bicycle components the need to assess a security landscape of such components becomes paramount as seen by the changes in the automotive industry.

% \section{Threat Model}

\section{Devices}

\subsection{SRAM Force eTap AXS}
The SRAM Force eTap AXS \cite{etap} is marketed toward professional, competitive bikers, and is priced the most premium out of all of our components. It works completely wirelessly like the Archer Components D1X meaning there is no need for physical wire between the derailleur and the shifters. The SRAM is also the only one in our lineup that uses a proprietary protocol. The derailleur and the shifter communicate using the in-house AIREA protocol that operates within the 2.475Ghz frequency range. During a press event of this products, SRAM claims that  the protocol uses 128-bit rolling encryption and the system is "more secure than any cash machine" \cite{phillips2015SRAM}. The system also provides Bluetooth for connecting to a smartphone and ANT+ to send information to a bicycle computer.

To set up the SRAM system, the biker will have to click a button on the derailleur to enter pairing mode and then click the buttons on both shifters consecutively to finish the pairing process. To connect to a mobile phone, the biker will start an app on their phone, select their SRAM system, and long-press a button on the derailleur to authorize. Note that the app provides ways to remap each shifter to different operations (gear up, gear down), but the user is not able to shift the gear directly in the app.




\section{Security Analysis}



\subsection{Threat Model \& Goal}
We want to protect the safety of the bikers using electronic shifters as sudden shifting when unintended may cause harm. We assume a scenario where bikers are joined with some malicious actors in a large-scale biking competition. In this scenario, we assume the adversary has access to the type of shifter the victim is using. The adversary can also be in close proximity with the victim before or during the competition, as a result, they can send arbitrary radio signals to the victim. We further assume the adversary can have a very short period of physical access with the victim's bike before the competition, such as when the victim is going to a restroom.

We define a successful attack as making a victim's bike shift to an unintended gear during competition. We will also define a successful attack as making a victims bike be unable to respond to legitimate shifting commands during competition. We assume all competitors will do a quick test ride before the competition and don't consider denial of service before the competition as a successful attack since this does not introduce safety risks to the riders. For that reason, simple attacks such as cutting the victim's breaking cable or poking a hole in the victim's tire will be trivially easy to spot during the test ride and thus won't qualify as a successful attack.


\subsection{Bluetooth Pairing Weakness}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Component Bluetooth pairing authentication methods and app capabilities}
  \label{tab:btauth}
\end{table}

All of our components provide Bluetooth connectivity and have companion mobile applications, so the user can configure or shift from their mobile phone. Like all Bluetooth products, a pairing process must be done before the user can interact with their device. Preventing unintended users from connecting is more important in biking shifters than traditional Bluetooth devices since a sudden change of gear when the biker is climbing or performing stunts can cause injuries to the riders. In addition, changes made to the gear settings from mobile applications aren't visible outside of the application. Our line up of components employ various degrees of authentication to prevent this from happenning. Table \ref{tab:btauth} summarize the components' authentication methods and their mobile apps' capabilities.

\paragraph{SRAM}
The SRAM uses a more traditional pairing mechanism where the app will prompt the user to physically press a button on the derailleur to authorize a connection. The system can also only pair with one smartphone at a time, therefore, when another device wants to connect, a physical button press is required even if that device had paired with the system before. While this is the industry standard of such Bluetooth pairing process, several key differences make the solution not ideal for an electronic shifter.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Highly possible to expose to an attacker} Unlike some Bluetooth personal belongings, such as a wireless headset, where the owner is expected to be always in possession of the device, bikes can be parked in a public space. Since the SRAM's pairing button is exposed as shown in Figure 2, the attacker will be able to pair with the bike in very a short period.
  \item \textbf{Not immediately noticable} Most Bluetooth devices use Bluetooth for their primary function. If the authorized device changes, the device owner will be locked out and immediately initiate a re-pair process, rendering the attacker’s device useless. However, in the case of an electronic shifter, the shifter is fully functional without any Bluetooth connection. Therefore, it will be very easy to overlook during a pre-ride checking and the attacker can choose a most dangerous time to send malicious command to the shifter.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:srambtn}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Exposed SRAM pairing button \cite{james_sram_2021}}
\end{figure}

Even though SRAM's app does not provide direct shifting capabilities, they also provide a way to swap the higher and lower gear switch, the adversary can wait for the exact moment to swap the switch thus poses threat to the rider. Furthermore, the system will not actively alert the owner that a pairing event had happened. The only way for the owner to notice is when they want to configure their bike as the app will prompt the user to re-pair to the bike. Even then, the user might not understand that their bike had been paired with other devices and not implement any safety measure.

\subsection{SRAM Replay Attack}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=230pt]{images/replay.png}
    \label{fig:Replay}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Visual depiction of an adversarial replay attack}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{SRAM ARIEA protocol} From public FCC data, we know that the SRAM system's operating frequency is around 2.475GHz with a bandwidth of 3MHz, therefore, we use an SDR and the Universal Radio Hacker software \cite{urh} to analyze the signals between the shifters and the derailleur. During the investigation, we reveal some facts about the protocol.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The shifter emit signal} We find out that every time the shifter is pressed, it will emit a signal continuously for about 1.2 seconds.
  \item \textbf{No ACK-like signal from the derailleur} We verify this by turning off the derailleur and do not observe any significant difference in the captured signal compared with those captured with the derailleur on.
  \item \textbf{Two main types of packets} We discover that the left and right shifter emit different types of packets. The difference is so significant that it is observable from the waveform.
  \item \textbf{Effective range} While we do not measure the exact effective range of the system, we do find out that the derailleur responds even if the shifters and the derailleur are over 10 meters apart.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Replay vulnerability}
We further discover that recording a signal from a shifter and replaying it will cause the derailleur to act accordingly, though there are some restrictions. We can only replay the latest packets from each shifter (one per shifter). As soon as the user sends the same
type of signal (by pressing the same side of the shifter), the previously stored packet will be invalidated. We suspect that each shifter has its internal counter that the derailleur keep track of, so it can invalidate all previous packets after receiving a new one, but we are not able to confirm this.

\paragraph{Attack implementation} The ability to replay the latest packet still opens up a way to attack the system. Based on the aforementioned vulnerability, we designed an algorithm specifically to attack an SRAM system during competition. We set up the SDR in a way that it will continuously switch between receiver and sender mode. During the receiver mode, the SDR will capture signals from the air and detect if it contains an SRAM gearing signal. If it does, it stores the new signal. Then it will send the saved signal (either the newly captured one or something stored before) to the air, causing the victim's bike to shift unintendedly.

Since SRAM does not release their firmware let alone source code, we do not have a reliable way to detect whether a signal segment contains an SRAM shifting packet or not. Therefore, we use a simple SVM classifier to solve the problem. We prerecorded several SRAM gearing signal segments and trained the model along with white noise and signal from other 2.4Ghz devices. In the end, we can reach 100\% accuracy in a lab environment.

We setup the attack with a HackRF One SDR. Under the attack, when the victim shifts near the attacker, their derailleur will continuously shift to the highest or lowest, and even if the victim counter shift, they will find out that their system shift to the other extreme direction.
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{SRAM replay attack algorithm}\label{alg:cap}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $saved \gets None$
    \While {$True$}
    \State Set up SDR in receiver mode
    \State $signal \gets$ get signal from SDR for 1 second
    \If{$signal\;match\;SRAM\;pattern$}
    \State $saved \gets signal$
    \State Setup SDR in sender mode
    \State Send $saved$
    \EndIf
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Potential Optimization}
In the attack, if the victim happens to shift the same gear while the SDR is in sender mode,
subsequent attacks will fail. However, there are possible ways to optimize this attack.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Use two SDRs one for receiving and one for sending.} Clearly, in this setting, the attacker will be able to notice the victim's signal while they are sending their malicious signal. However, the attacker's receiver will now be interfered by their sender, and special care needs to be done to avoid confusion.
  \item \textbf{Trim the saved data.} During investigation, we found out that while the signal from the shifter lasted over 1 second, 50ms worth of data is enough to cause the derailleur to act. Therefore, it is possible that we can trim the data so that the SDR can send the data and be in sender mode for just a little amount if time, greatly reducing the chance of missing the victim's signal.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}

Our first recommendation is the implementation of passcodes/PINS for pairing with smartphones. The Shimano Di2 implemented a 6 digit PIN for pairing that we found to be an effective measure for preventing basic attacks such as the one presented for the Archer in Section 5.2. While previous research by Shaked and Wool~ \cite{bluepin} has demonstrated that these PIN’s are easily crackable they present a first line of defense and implementations such as the Shimano’s require the attacker to manually restart the pairing process upon incorrect entry. Thus, we recommend that all connections to the shifters require a PIN and have a mechanism for temporarily locking out devices after incorrect entry.

Our second recommendation is the implementation of timestamps in shifting communication packets to prevent replay attacks such as the one demonstrated in 5. The inclusion of a timestamp in every packet would allow the systems to detect when a packet has been replayed later in time. Another possible approach would be the creation of session keys between the shifter and shifting box. These session keys would be generated every packet and a subsequent replay would be denied. Interestingly, the SRAM groupset creates a similar encryption code but only utilizes it to prevent the mixing of shifting signals from other bikes with the same groupset~ \cite{etapsecure}.


\section{Conclusions}

The shifters that we examined represent the forefront of wireless shifting in bicycles. As the field matures and consumer adoption increases we can expect security to be a larger concern.
In our paper, we presented a novel threat model that focuses on remote attacks that pose a direct threat to the user through unexpected shifting. In accordance with our threat model, we present several Bluetooth pairing vulnerabilities along with a replay attack on the SRAM groupset. We also discuss potential countermeasures to these vulnerabilities such as pairing PINS and session keys/timestamps for packets. Our findings represent the first analysis of the security landscape of wireless shifting in bicycles.


\section{Future Work}

The security landscape of wireless shifters remains largely unstudied and there are several specific areas that we would like to study further. Firstly, we would like to examine the firmware of the shifters for specific vulnerabilities. We would also like to the examine the security of firmware updates and see whether an adversary could load malicious code into the shifter. While we did examine the shifting packets, we would like to do further analysis. Specifically, we would like to spend more time configuring crackle and testing it against different logs. We would also like to attempt MITM and replay attacks with the packets. We would also like to configure a phone that doesn’t have Bluetooth security protocols such as those implemented by Apple. Lastly, we would like to attempt to hack Shimano’s new wireless shifting groupset~ \cite{newshimano}. While the one that we analyzed could connect to a mobile application for configuration the new groupset will have wireless communication between the shifter and derailleur. This increased attack surface opens up the possibility of a replay attack such as the SRAM one being possible.

\section{Appendix}
During the research we used the following firmware versions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item SRAM eTAP Phone App 2.0.9, Firmware Version 2.7.6
\end{itemize}
\section{Group Contributions}

Most of the work and attack planning was done in group meetings, although we were still able to split a lot of the work up by component. Together we got the Archer, Di2, and SRAM working, and did some of the initial replay attacks against the SRAM together. Cody wrote the code and finished testing the SRAM replay attack and examine its bluetooth pairing properties. Since the Shimano and Archer both relied on Bluetooth, Tolga and Thomas worked together to test the Shimano Di2 and Archer Components D1x shifters and examine their Bluetooth protocols. We all took part in writing the final paper and slide presentation.
